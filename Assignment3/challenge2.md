## Challenge 2
to know that the training data they are using is “balanced”

### Functional Requirements
- as an AI developer, you need the system have training data that does not contain biases.
  + the system should be able to tell what causes biases.
  + the system should be able to detect biases in new data compared to previous data.
  + the system should be able to filter biased data.

### Assumptions 
- The new data that doesn't comply with previous data are still needed.
- The old data might need to be removed in the future due to the biases.

### Validation
- Do you need to store the biased data.
- Do you need to adjust the content if the previous data is wrong.
